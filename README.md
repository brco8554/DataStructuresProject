Project Plan: dictator.cpp

Weighted graph of cities, using populations to the city.

Each city has a red black list of citizens, with associated physical attributes (maybe hair and eye color).


Functions to call:
Execute citizen: deletes chosen citizen from chosen city.
Add citizen: adds a citizen to a city
Activate Eugenics: executes citizens that don't have certain attributes
Glass city: obliterates a city and all inhabitants of city.
Move citizen: move citizen from one city to another
Relocate & Destroy: move all citizens from one city to another, destroy city
Find Min Population: Finds the city with the smallest population

	My project will consist of a weighted graph of cities, which each contain a red black tree containing the citizens in the city. Each citizen will have some physical attributes associated with them, (the type you'd see on a driver's license). From here, there are several public methods that can be used. Described above. A combination of these public methods would prove most useful. With this, you can become the perfect dictator.
